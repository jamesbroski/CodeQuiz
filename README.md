# CodeQuiz

In this assignment, we were asked to build a quiz from the ground uo using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The idea was to have a series of questions that the user was asked. The score was contingent on a timer counting down throughout the quiz.
An incorrect answer deducted time from the clock, and reduced your overall score. 

Below is a screenshot of what the user might see when taking the quiz:

Overall this assignment was very layered, building on what we have learned thus far in the bootcamp. While mine was unable to work how I intended, I still enjoyed the process
and shed light on what I need to continue to work on!
